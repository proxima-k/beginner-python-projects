Beginner projects I made with python when I started coding (2019-2020)

The link to the list of project was this: https://github.com/jorgegonzalez/beginner-projects , but it was removed.
Fortunately, another user has uploaded the list of projects. You can check out the repo here: https://github.com/jclane/beginner-project-solutions
